The Grand Scheme of Things is a video game. There are 4 entities, God, Time, Truth and Man. God created Time, so Man could flow in the river of existence. God created Truth, so Man could fight it's ripple. But, God never told Man of their presence. God bestowed upon Man the flower of Desire. Man gladly accepted, unbeknownst of its shackles.Time is ever-flowing. Without it, Man cannot exist. Truth is omnipresent. It manifests one of the many paths that Man has. Man is a slave to his Desire. The path of Desire may become one with that of the Truth.
